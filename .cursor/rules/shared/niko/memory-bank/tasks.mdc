# Tasks

The "Tasks" file is the active task tracking: current task details, checklists, component lists.
It contains an exhaustive checklist of all the necessary steps to do, in order, to complete the current task.

## File

`memory-bank/tasks.md`

## How to Create

When planning work, fill out the task list with sections of checklists appropriate to the complexity level of the current task.

## When to Update

🚨 **CRITICAL:** The task list is a living document and must be updated as work is completed. At most one subsection of the task list should be completed before stopping to update it!

After any significantly-large changeset is made:

* in terms of quantity of files affected
* in terms of lines of content affected

stop and 

1. update the task list to indicate the progress of the work
2. commit the changes AND the task list updates with commit message format: `chore: saving progress on [task name]`

## Format

The task list should begin with a header:

~~~markdown
# Current Task: [Task Name]

**Complexity:** [complexity level]

...

~~~

🚨 **CRITICAL:** Specific task list formats beyond the header come from the appropriate complexity-specific planning rules. Do NOT invent your own formats.
