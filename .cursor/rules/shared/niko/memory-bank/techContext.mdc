# Tech Context

The "Tech Context" summarizes how to work with the technology stack(s) in use in the project. It identifies the tools, commands, and frameworks that should be top-of-mind while working on the project. It does NOT include session-specific info (current branch, current task, local environment, etc).

## File

`memory-bank/techContext.md`

## How to Create

Scan the codebase for significant technologies (nonstandard or high-criticality) and document them. Look for design system authorities too - if the project has UI components, check for Figma links, Storybook configs, design token files, component library references, or brand guidelines.

This is largely a free-form document designed to capture and surface information that would otherwise require time and effort to discover.

Prefer to name things that are likely to remain static, and link out to configuration for those technologies, so that the document doesn't go stale.

For example, instead of listing all test-related commands from a `package.json`, note something like 

> Tests are run in the `jest` framework as configured in `package.json` and `jest.config.js`, and run with the `pnpm` tool.

This ensures that even if the *specifics* of testing are free to change, the general guidance in this file remains valid.

Err on the side of brevity - if you're not sure if something needs to be mentioned, don't document it. For example, if a project has a `package.json`, it probably uses `javascript` and so you don't need to document *that*. But if it has a `package.json` *and* a `pom.xml`, for example, well, that's unusual and probably worth investigating and documenting.

## Format

Create the file in Markdown format, according to this template:

# Tech Context

short summary of the project's technology stack(s)

## Environment Setup

Any crucial environment setup instructions that must be followed and/or validated before the project can be worked on.

## Build Tools

Short punchlist of the build tool(s) in the project, with links to each tool's canonical configuration.

## Testing Process

Short punchlist of the tools and commands used to test and validate the project, with links to each tool's canonical configuration.

## Design System

(Include only if the project has user-facing UI.)

Pointers to the canonical visual style authorities: design token files, Figma/Sketch URLs, Storybook instance, component library, brand guidelines. These are references, not definitions - the design system itself lives wherever the project keeps it.

It is acceptable to add sections to the file if needed for a project-specific situation, but be sparing.
