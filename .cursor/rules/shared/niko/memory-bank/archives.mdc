# Archives

Archives are the final documentation of a completed project.
They are created after the project is verified as complete.

## Files

Archives are stored in the `memory-bank/archive/<kind>/` directory.
Archive files are named in the format `YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`.

Archives are categorized into the following kinds:
- `bug-fixes/` - something was wrong, but it has been corrected
- `enhancements/` - an existing feature or capability has been improved or extended
- `features/` - an entirely new feature or capability has been added
- `systems/` - a major change to the system has been made

## How to Create

Each task complexity level has its own guidelines for creating an archive - different levels have different levels of detail and depth required.

All important information from ephemeral files (such as reflections, creative docs, QA/testing status) should be ***inlined*** in the archive document, not linked, as ephemeral files are deleted after archiving. The archive document should stand on its own as a complete account of the work.

If an archive section has no meaningful content, include it but add a small note as to why this work didn't produce any meaningful content for the section.

## Format

Archives use the following format:

~~~markdown
---
task_id: [task-id]
complexity_level: [n]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: completed
