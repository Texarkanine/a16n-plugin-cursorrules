# QA Validation Status

The QA validation status file is a simple text file used to track the status of the QA validation phase of a task.

The QA validation status file is stored in the `memory-bank/.qa-validation-status` file.

If QA validation passes, the file contains the text `PASS`.

If QA validation fails, the file should contain the text `FAIL`.
