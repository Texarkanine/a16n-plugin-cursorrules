# System Patterns

The "System Patterns" is the architectural patterns of this collection of files: code organization, naming conventions, design patterns in use.

## File

`memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

## How to Create

Scan the codebase for significant patterns (nonstandard or high-criticality) and document them.
This is largely a free-form document designed to capture and surface information that would otherwise require time and effort to discover.

Do not document obvious patterns - for example, a project with a `pyproject.toml` should not say "This project uses python."

However, a project with a `pyproject.toml` *and* a `setup.py` *and* a `requirements.txt` should probably include something about the design that necessitates all three of them.

Err on the side of brevity - if you're not sure if something is exceptional, don't document it.
This document can be appended to later as actual work reveals patterns that would benefit from documentation.

## Format

Create the file in Markdown format, according to this template:

~~~markdown
# System Patterns

## Pattern 1

Succint description of pattern, with a pointer to instances and/or evidence

## Pattern 2
