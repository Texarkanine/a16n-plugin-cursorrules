# Active Context

The "Active Context" is the current session focus: what's being worked on now, recent decisions, immediate next steps. A pointer to the current phase.
This is an ideological parent of the `memory-bank/tasks.md` task list, containing high-level objectives & results for the current session and phase.
This file serves a pre-computed "compacted context" to enable pausing and resuming of work - concise summaries of the current thinking, decisions, and actions.

## File

`memory-bank/activeContext.md`

## How to Create

Once the current phase and its work have been identified, this file can be filled out.

## When to Update

As work is completed and decisions are made, this file can be updated.

🚨 **CRITICAL:** All decisions made by the user after asking them for any kind of input should be recorded into this file as they are made.

## Format

## Example

~~~markdown
# Active Context

## Current Task: niko-preflight-qa
**Phase:** BUILD - COMPLETE (rework — all PR #38 review feedback addressed)

## What Was Done
- P0: Reverted 4 visual-maps files to main, applied surgical semantic edits (diff reduced from 2262 to 368 lines)
- P1: Fixed workflow completeness — always archive for L2+, correct phase counts
- P2: Trimmed duplication — commands reference `/niko-preflight` and `/niko-qa` instead of reproducing procedures; consolidated archive dotfile cleanup; nested build prerequisites by level
- P3: Added "Output to Operator" section to all 6 commands; deleted 2 obsolete files; updated common-fixes.mdc for semantic QA

## Next Step
- QA PASSED — proceed to `/niko-reflect`
