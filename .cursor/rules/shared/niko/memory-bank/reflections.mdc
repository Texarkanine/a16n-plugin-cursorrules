# Reflections

Reflections are task-specific collections of outcomes and insights, created after a task is completed.
After each build session, a reflection *may* be created; it's recommended to reflect whenever you *think* you've finished implementing the vision in the `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
User feedback that sends you back to build or adjust will cause a new build session and another reflection at the end of that, etc.

Accumulating reflections allows code reviewers and other authors to understand the methodology that got you to where you are.

Reflections are ephemeral files that will eventually be collapsed into a single Archive document, once the project is verified as complete.

## Files

Reflection are stored in the `memory-bank/reflection/` directory.
Reflection files are named in the format `reflection-<task-id>.md`.

## How to Create

Each task complexity level has its own guidelines for creating a reflection - different levels have different levels of detail and depth required.

## Format

Reflections use the following format:

~~~markdown
---
task_id: [task-id]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
complexity_level: [n]
---

# Reflection: [Task Name]

## Summary

[summary of the task]

<!-- complexity-level specific sections -->
