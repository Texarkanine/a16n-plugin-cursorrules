# Progress

The "Progress" file tracks the journey of the current project from start to finish.
For each work session, the work, decisions, and outcomes are recorded, along with the phase that it happened in.
This file will accumulate the history of the project's journey from start to finish.

## File

`memory-bank/progress.md`

## How to Create

This file should be created when the first work session of a project is started.

## When to Update

When sufficient tasks in `memory-bank/tasks.md` have completed such that the `memory-bank/activeContext.md` is ready to be changed to a new focus, that information gets moved to a succint section in this file.
Each time this file is updated, a *new* section should be *appended* to the *bottom* of the file.

🚨 **CRITICAL:** The progress **must** be updated whenever a phase is completed.

## Format

Create the file in Markdown format, according to this template:

~~~markdown
# Progress

## Example

~~~markdown
# Progress

Building out and bootstrapping the new project w/ basic setup.

**Complexity:** Level 3

## 2024-06-12 - FEATURE DEVELOPMENT - IN-PROGRESS

* Work completed
    - Initialized new TypeScript webapp project with Vite
    - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and basic lint/fmt scripts
    - Added initial folder structure: `src/`, `public/`, `types/`
    - Created basic HomePage and App shell components
    - Configured project for strict type checking
* Decisions made
    - Decided to use Vite for fast development and hot module replacement
    - Selected TypeScript strict mode to enforce better code quality

## 2024-06-15 - FEATURE DEVELOPMENT - COMPLETE

* Work completed
    - Implemented authentication flow (login, logout, registration)
    - Established API client with error handling and token refresh strategy
    - Built reusable UI component library (Button, Input, Modal)
    - Wrote unit and integration tests for auth and shared components
    - Deployed staging app to Vercel
* Decisions made
    - Chose React Query for API state management
    - Adopted CSS Modules for local component styling
    - Standardized all API error responses to a common interface
* Insights
    - Integrating ESLint and Prettier early prevented many code style issues
    - Building components with strict typesurfaced bugs before runtime
    - Upfront investment in shared UI components accelerated feature work later
