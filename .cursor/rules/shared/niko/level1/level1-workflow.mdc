# Level 1 Workflow: Quick Bug Fix

Level 1 tasks are isolated bug fixes affecting a single component. Prioritize speed — but never skip the test.

## Workflow Phases

```mermaid
graph LR
    Start(("Complexity Analysis")) --> NikoBuild["🐱 Build"]
    NikoBuild --> NikoQA{"🐱 QA"}
    NikoQA -->|"PASS"| Done("Done")
    NikoQA -->|"FAIL"| NikoBuild
```

Level 1 tasks skip `/niko-plan`, `/niko-creative`, and `/niko-preflight`. Go straight to build.
Level 1 tasks are *simple* so there's no `/niko-reflect` or `/niko-archive` after building, either. A commit message & description are sufficient record.

## Phase Mappings

To execute a phase for a level 1 task:

1. Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to indicate completion of the phase you are leaving.
2. Commit all changes - memory bank *and* other resources - to source control using a conventional commit in the following format: `chore: saving work before [phase] phase`.
3. Read and follow the instructions in the appropriate locations:
    - **Level 1 Build Phase**: Load `.cursor/rules/shared/niko/level1/level1-build.mdc`
    - **Level 1 QA Phase**: Invoke the `niko-qa` skill
