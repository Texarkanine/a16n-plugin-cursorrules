# Creative Phase: Authoring Template

This document is a meta-template for ruleset authors creating new creative phase types. It is NOT loaded during task execution. If you're an agent working on a task, you should be in one of the specialized creative phases - not here.

## When to Create a New Creative Phase Type

Create a new type when a domain of open questions recurs often enough that:
1. The same evaluation criteria apply repeatedly
2. The same Step 1 framing pattern applies repeatedly
3. The generic creative phase produces worse results because it lacks domain-specific guidance

If the above aren't true, the generic creative phase covers it. Don't create a new type for a one-off.

## Contract

Every creative phase type must satisfy this contract. The `niko-creative` skill depends on it.

### Required Inputs Section

```markdown
## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)
```

### Required Steps

The phase must include these steps, in order. Step names and evaluation criteria should be domain-appropriate, but the structure is fixed:

1. **Step 1: Frame/Define** - Scope the decision precisely. The agent should not proceed until the problem is concrete enough to evaluate options against. This step varies most across phase types (algorithm: define inputs/outputs/invariants; architecture: rank quality attributes; uiux: understand users; generic: frame the decision point).

2. **Step 2: Enumerate Options** - Identify 2-4 viable approaches. Each gets a name, a one-sentence description, and a note on existing implementations or project pattern alignment.

3. **Step 3: Analyze Tradeoffs** - Compare options against domain-specific evaluation criteria. Use a comparison table for 3+ options. Note key insights. Include a "guard against" list of common mistakes for this domain.

4. **Step 4: Decide** - Select the winner or declare low confidence. Must include: which option, why it won, what was traded away, implementation notes. Must end with:
   ```markdown
   If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!
   ```

5. **Step 5: Output Document** - Write to `memory-bank/creative/creative-[question-name].md`. The format must include at minimum:
   - A domain-appropriate header (e.g., "Algorithm Decision:", "Architecture Decision:", "Decision:")
   - Options Evaluated (bulleted, one-line summaries)
   - Analysis (table or prose)
   - Key insights
   - Decision section with both high-confidence and low-confidence formats:
     ```markdown
     <!-- if a high-confidence result, use this format: -->
     **Selected**: [Option name]
     **Rationale**: [Why this won]
     **Tradeoff**: [What was accepted/sacrificed]
     <!-- if a low-confidence result, use this format: -->
     **Low-Confidence Result**: [Why no clear winner emerged]
     ```
   - Implementation Notes (for high-confidence results)

   Additional sections specific to the domain (e.g., architecture adds "Requirements & Constraints" and "Components"; uiux adds "User & Context" and "Design System") go before Options Evaluated.

### What NOT to Include

- No "Output to Operator" section. The `niko-creative` skill handles operator output by reading the Decision section of the output document.
- No complexity-level scaling. The creative skill routes by question type, not by level. The phase type should work the same regardless of whether the parent task is L2, L3, or L4.
- No verification checklists. The structure itself is the verification - if all steps are completed, the output is complete.
- No mermaid workflow diagrams of the steps. The steps are linear and numbered; a diagram adds nothing.

## Registration

After creating a new creative phase type, update the `niko-creative` skill's Step 3 (Route to Creative Phase Type) to include the new type with:
- A name
- A file path
- A one-sentence description of when to use it (what kind of open questions it handles)

# Creative Phase: [Domain Name]

This document guides exploration of an open question about [domain description]. It is loaded by the `niko-creative` skill.

## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)

## Step 1: [Domain-Specific Framing Verb]

[Domain-specific guidance for scoping the decision]

## Step 2: Enumerate Options

Identify 2-4 viable approaches. For each:
- Name the approach
- One sentence describing how it addresses the open question
- Note if existing project patterns favor or conflict with this approach

## Step 3: Analyze Tradeoffs

Compare options against these criteria:

1. [Domain-specific criterion 1]
2. [Domain-specific criterion 2]
...

[Comparison table template]

Guard against:
- [Domain-specific anti-pattern 1]
- [Domain-specific anti-pattern 2]

## Step 4: Decide

Select the winning option. State:
- Which option was selected
- Why it won
- What was traded away
- Implementation notes

If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!

## Step 5: Output Document

Write to `memory-bank/creative/creative-[question-name].md`:
