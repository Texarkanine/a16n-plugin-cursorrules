# Creative Phase: UI/UX Design

This document guides exploration of an open question about user-facing design - how to present information, interaction flows, visual layout, accessibility, or style decisions. It is loaded by the `niko-creative` skill.

## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)

## Step 1: Design System Check

Before anything else, check `memory-bank/techContext.md` for a "Design System" section.

- **If present**: Load the referenced design authorities (Figma, Storybook, design tokens, component library, brand guidelines). All visual design proposals in this exploration must conform to them. Design system adherence is a mandatory evaluation criterion in Step 3.
- **If absent**: Ask the operator whether the project has visual style authorities that should be referenced. If yes, add them to the Design System section of `memory-bank/techContext.md` before continuing. If no (e.g., greenfield project), note this and proceed - but flag that design decisions made here should become the foundation for a future design system.

## Step 2: Understand the User & Context

Clarify who is using this and what they need:
- **Users**: Who are they? What are their goals, constraints, and skill level?
- **Task**: What specific task or workflow does this UI support?
- **Context**: Where does this appear in the broader application? What comes before and after?
- **Constraints**: Device targets, accessibility requirements (WCAG level), platform conventions

## Step 3: Enumerate Options

Identify 2-4 viable design approaches. For each:
- Name the approach (e.g., "wizard flow", "single-page form", "progressive disclosure dashboard")
- One sentence describing the interaction model
- A brief description or ASCII sketch of the layout - enough to convey the concept, not a pixel-perfect mockup

Consider these dimensions when generating options:
- **Information architecture**: How is content structured and navigated?
- **Interaction model**: How does the user accomplish the task? (steps, direct manipulation, conversational)
- **Visual hierarchy**: What draws attention first? How is importance communicated?

## Step 4: Evaluate Tradeoffs

Compare options against these criteria:

1. **Usability**: Can the target users accomplish their task efficiently and without confusion?
2. **Clarity**: Is the information hierarchy clear? Does the user always know where they are and what to do next?
3. **Accessibility**: Does it meet the required WCAG level? Keyboard navigable? Sufficient contrast? Screen reader compatible?
4. **Consistency**: Does it align with existing UI patterns in the application and with the design system (if one exists)?
5. **Feasibility**: Can it be implemented with the project's tech stack without heroics?
6. **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest design that meets the user's needs? Resist adding UI elements that don't serve a clear purpose.

If a design system exists, add: **Design system adherence** - does the option conform to established colors, typography, spacing, and component patterns?

Use a comparison table when three or more options are evaluated:

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Usability | ... | ... | ... |
| Clarity | ... | ... | ... |
| Accessibility | ... | ... | ... |
| Consistency | ... | ... | ... |
| Feasibility | ... | ... | ... |

Note key insights - where user needs create tension with feasibility, where accessibility requirements constrain visual options, or where consistency with existing patterns conflicts with optimal UX.

Guard against:
- Designing for edge cases at the expense of the primary flow
- Visual complexity that impresses but confuses
- Ignoring accessibility as a "nice to have"

## Step 5: Decide

Select the winning option. State:
- Which option was selected
- Why it won (tied to user needs and evaluation criteria)
- What was traded away (the key tradeoff(s) accepted, if any)
- Implementation notes: key interaction details, responsive behavior, accessibility implementation, design system references

If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!

## Step 6:Output Document

Write to `memory-bank/creative/creative-[question-name].md`:

# UI/UX Decision: [Question Name]

## User & Context
[Who uses this, what task it supports, where it fits in the application]

## Design System
[References to design authorities used, or note that none exists]

## Options Evaluated
- **[Option A]**: [one-line summary + brief layout description]
- **[Option B]**: [one-line summary + brief layout description]

## Analysis
[Comparison table if 3+ options, or prose comparison for 2 options]

Key insights:
- [Where user needs and feasibility create tension]
- [Accessibility or consistency constraints that shaped the decision]

## Decision

<!-- if a high-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Selected**: [Option name]
**Rationale**: [Why this won, tied to user needs and criteria]
**Tradeoff**: [What was accepted/sacrificed]

## Implementation Notes
- [Key interaction details]
- [Responsive behavior]
- [Accessibility implementation]
- [Design system references]

<!-- if a low-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Low-Confidence Result**: [Why no clear winner emerged]
