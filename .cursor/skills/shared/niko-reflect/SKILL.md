# Reflect Phase - Post-Implementation Reflection

This command produces a structured reflection on the task just completed - what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently next time. Reflection depth scales with complexity level - this file routes to the appropriate level-specific reflection document.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`

## Step 2: Determine Complexity Level

Read the complexity level from `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

If no complexity level is set, or `memory-bank/activeContext.md` does not exist: 🛑 STOP! It doesn't make sense to reflect before a task has been completed.

Ask the operator for clarification, and wait for their instructions. You're done for now.

## Step 3: Route to Level-Specific Reflection

Load the appropriate complexity level-specific Niko workflow file, then use its Phase Mappings to execute the Reflect phase.
